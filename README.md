**preCog** is a comprehensive deep‚Äêlearning framework for predicting incident coronary artery disease (CAD) using multimodal data‚Äîcardiovascular MRI, liver & pancreatic MRI, DXA, ECG, and polygenic risk scores‚Äîdeveloped by Devansh Pandey _et al._ and published in _XXX_.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Leverage diverse data sources to improve 10-year CAD risk prediction beyond traditional scores (e.g., Framingham Risk Score).
- **Key Result:** preCog identfies a subgrop with a 10.4x incent CAD risk compared to Framigham Risk Score baseline by effectively using imaging and genetics on top of tradiational biomarkers.
- **Modalities:**
  - Cardiac MRI (3D cine long axis, aortic distesibility and blood flow)
  - Liver & Pancreas MRI
  - Full-body DXA
  - 12-lead ECG traces
  - Blood Biochemistry
  - Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)
  - Demogrpahic Data
